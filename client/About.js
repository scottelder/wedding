          I have never had a first date like my first date with Scott. I
          developed a crush on him--one I worked vigorously to squash for the
          sake of professionalism--from the moment I sat down with him at lunch
          on his first day as a student at Hack Reactor. We talked about Kelly
          Link and other books, and I was immediately taken with his steely blue
          eyes and his cheeky sense of humor. My first thought was: Oh, girl.
          You are in trouble! You can’t have a crush on a student! So I kept my
          distance and did my job, and didn’t let myself think too much about
          how cute and kind and funny and smart and attractive he was.

          So when we sat down to dinner in the warm red light of the
          Kemuri-Tatsuya patio on our first date, we immediately tumbled right
          into “So we’re both super in love with each other, right?” Our first
          date was this fizzy reminiscence about all the almost-moments where
          we’d each wanted to let the other person know. The company lake day
          where Scott jumped off a roof to impress me and I swam across the
          river to impress him. The dinner party where I kept hoping he’d stick
          around to “help with dishes,” and instead he took too long tying his
          shoes and then slunk away. The crafternoon he showed up to mostly so
          he could ask me out, but was blocked by a lingering coworker who spent
          so much time nattering on about the horse she was drawing that I had
          to usher everyone out to get to a yoga class and Scott missed his
          shot.

          Since then, we’ve had a couple years, many more dates, and a global
          pandemic to get to know each other more deeply, and to turn those
          almost-moments into a shared life. I love Scott’s kindness and his
          resilience. I love the way he cheers me on and supports me. The way he
          approaches things thoughtfully. I love the way we operate as a team,
          the way we communicate and face difficulties together. And I am so
          excited to spend the rest of my life with him.

          I knew from the first time I saw her. Later, there would be doubt and
          fear, but that first moment was crystalline certainty. We were sitting
          in the Hack Reactor classroom, about to commence my cohort’s first day
          of web dev boot camp, and she looked amazing. I’m not permitted to
          broadcast what my very first thoughts were, but it’s safe to say they
          started a six-months-long odyssey of overthinking our every
          interaction.

        <Paragraph>
          The first date after months of agony was electric. We were so clearly
          on the same wavelength it made me wonder why we’d waited so long to
          get together. Everything that came after was tuned to that same
          frenetic frequency built on the foundation we’d built communicating
          and solving problems together at Hack Reactor for the past six months.
          It felt easy, not because relationships are easy, but because we had
          such a good rapport that we tackled problems in tandem cleaned up
          messes before they could fester into anything serious.

          The final test was, of course, my dog Duke. If you’ve met him, you
          know he’s a major league piece of shit — anxious, nosy, and defensive
          for all the wrong reasons. He’s hard to love but well worth the effort
          once it he lets you into his bubble. Linden had expressed her distaste
          for small, anxious dogs in the past and I was worried that they
          wouldn’t get along once we moved in together, but nothing could have
          been further from the truth. Their deep affection for one another is
          clear and Duke now prefers to come to her for pets and cuddling even
          when we’re sitting on the couch next to each other. It’s absolutely
          wonderful.

          I knew from the first; I know now, too. My feelings have only matured
          and distilled as our relationship grew. We’ve had more crises, more
          arguments, and more time alone with each other over the last two years
          than anyone could have guessed and through it all we’ve maintained the
          same problem-solving dynamic that made the early days move so quickly.
          I can’t wait to tie the knot and get back to the business of growing
          and learning together.
